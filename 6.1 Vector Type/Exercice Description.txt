Write a constructor Vector that represents a vector in two-dimensional space.
It takes x and y parameters (numbers), which it should save to properties of the same name.
Give the Vector prototype two methods,plus and minus, that take another vector as a parameter
and return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two
vectors’ (the one in this and the parameter)x and y values.Add a getter property length to 
the prototype that computes the length of the vector—that is, the distance of the point (x,y)
from the origin (0, 0).
