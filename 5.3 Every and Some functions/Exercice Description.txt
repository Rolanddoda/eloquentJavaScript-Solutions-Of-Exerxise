Create 2 functions:

1st: The function called every and takes 2 arguments.An array and a callback function which has a condition
The logic is that this function will iterate the array to find if the condition matches all elements

2st: The function called some and takes the same arguments as the above function.
The is that this function will iterate the array to find if the condition matches at least one element.


Calling the every function will lead to follow results:

console.log(every([1, 3, 5], n => n < 10));
// → true
console.log(every([2, 4, 16], n => n < 10));
// → false
console.log(every([], n => n < 10));
// → true


Calling the some function:

console.log(some([1, 3, 5], n => n > 10));
// → false
console.log(some([2, 4, 16], n => n < 10));
// → true
console.log(some([], n => n < 10));
// → false
