Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8×8 grid, 
using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the 
grid there is either a space or a “#” character. The characters should 
form a chess board. 
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # # 
 # # # #
# # # #
