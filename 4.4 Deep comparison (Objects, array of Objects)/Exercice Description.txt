The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would
prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.
Write a function, deepEqual , that takes two values and returns true only if
they are the same value or are objects with the same properties whose values
are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual .
To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the ===
operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you can use the typeof
operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep com-
parison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: by a historical
accident, typeof null also produces "object" .s
